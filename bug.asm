mov eax, [ebx + 4*ecx] ; This line assumes that the size of the data being accessed is 4 bytes. If the data is actually a different size (e.g., 8 bytes for a double), then the calculation is incorrect and will lead to memory corruption or other errors.  A more robust solution would be to use a scaled addressing mode appropriate for the data type, or explicitly calculate the offset using a different instruction.
